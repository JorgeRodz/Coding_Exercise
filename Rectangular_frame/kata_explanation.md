# Rectangular frame

Write a function that takes a list of strings and prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. For example the list ["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"] gets printed as:

```
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********

```

If the user input is empty...this is the output:

```
****
*  *
****
```

This is another example:

```
Input: ["Being", "a", "programmer", "is", "like", "being", "a", "wizard"]
**************
* Being      *
* a          *
* programmer *
* is         *
* like       *
* being      *
* a          *
* wizard     *
**************

```

User the programming language of your choice. Have fun!
