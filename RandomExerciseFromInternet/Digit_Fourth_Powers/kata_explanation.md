# Digit Fourth Powers
## Problem explanation
The problem is to find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits.
## Example with the power of 3
Surprisingly there are only four numbers that can be written as the sum of third powers of their digits:
```
153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3
370 = 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3
371 = 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3
407 = 4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3
```
The sum of these numbers is 153 + 370 + 371 + 407 = 1301.

## Example with the power of 4
For example, 1634 is a number that is equal to the sum of the fourth powers of its digits:
```
1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
```
Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits from 2 to 10000.
